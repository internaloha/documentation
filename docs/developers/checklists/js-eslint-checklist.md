Javascript and ESLint best practices.

## Javascript

### JS-01: Name classes, components, files, and directories appropriately.

Classes should be pascalcase starting with a capital letter.
  * Example: CourseInstance

React components should be pascalcase starting with a capital letter.
  * Example: AcademicView

Functions and arrow functions should be camelcase starting with a lowercase letter.
  * Example: findUser

Filenames for classes and React components should follow the rules for the classes or components.
  * Example: AcademicView.tsx

Filenames for helpers should be lowercase with dashes between words. These files should be in a utilities directory.
  * Example: ui/pages/utilities/explorer-helpers.ts

Directory names are lowercase with dashes between words.
  * Example: ui/components/students/item-view

### JS-03: Use the spread operator when appropriate.

Can you use the spread operator?

### JS-04: Use object deconstruction when appropriate.

Can you use object deconstruction?

### JS-05: Use arrow functions when appropriate.

Can you use arrow functions? Note that arrow functions are normally better, except in Mocha tests.

### JS-06: Avoid lodash map, filter, etc.

ES6 includes many of the lodash functions. Use the built-in function rather than the lodash version when possible.

### JS-07: Avoid console.log

Console.log is useful for certain situations in development. All console.log statements should be commented out in master.


### JS-08: Use JSDoc (TSDoc) comments appropriately.

When a comment starts with '/**', it will be processed by JSDoc (or TSDoc). Please ensure those comments are appropriate for inclusion.

## ESLint

### ESLINT-01: No errors, avoid warnings.

Are there ESLint errors or warnings that should be removed?

### ESLINT-02: Consider modifying our standards.

Based upon your review of code, should we be modifying the set of ESLint rules?
