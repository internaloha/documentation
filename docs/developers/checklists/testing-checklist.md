## Acceptance Test Checklist

### TEST-01: Each Page has an isDisplayed() acceptance test.

We use the "Page Object Model" to define one or more tests to exercise the behavior associated with the user interface.

For each page in the user interface, there should be an acceptance test that verifies that the page can be displayed successfully.

### TEST-02: Each form has an acceptance test.

If a page has a form, there is an associated acceptance test to ensure that it behaves correctly.
