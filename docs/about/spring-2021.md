title: Spring 2021 Project Planning
---

Here are the proposed goals for Spring 2021

## 1. InternAloha Pilot Evaluation

The goal of this project is to perform a preliminary evaluation of the InternAloha user interface in order to get initial feedback on the implementation from potential users.

We hope to complete this in early January.

Team members: Andre, Jenny

## 2. Code review and quality assurance

The goal of this project is to develop "best practices" for the InternAloha code base and to ensure that the code complies with these practices.

To accomplish this, we will institute a weekly review process. See [Review Chapter](../developers/review/overview) for details.

Team members: Andre, Jenny, Pauline, Philip

### 3. Scraper Development

According to the [Spring 2021 Project Board](https://github.com/internaloha/internaloha/projects/3), there are several additional scrapers that need to be developed.

### 4. Documentation

By the end of the semester, we hope to improve this site in several ways, including:

  * Improved [Checklists](../developers/checklists/overview).
  * A User Guide chapter.
  * Installation instructions.
